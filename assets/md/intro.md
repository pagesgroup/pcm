## Operation of the machine
The Polymac in-mould labelling machine is designed to insert labels in the mould and take completely injection moulded pails (with handles, if applicable) out of the mould.  The pails can optionally be checked and stacked.

Labels are placed manually in a magazine from which a label is picked up by the label gripper and placed accurately on a positioning plate. Another label gripper then picks up the label from the positioning plate and gives it to the robot that inserts it in the mould. A second parallel-running robot takes the injection moulded pail and handle out of the mould and gives it to a take-over unit. The pails are then placed on a transport system. The pail and handle are brought together and the handle is attached. The pails are stacked and transported out of the machine by a conveyor and placed on a roller conveyor.

# Safety
## Safety philosophy
Polymac BV complies with the safety strategy set forth in the Machinery Directive (Annex 1, §1.1.2) for reducing risks. This means: eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible by inherently safe design. In the latter case, there are residual risks and the most significant of these are set out in this manual and depicted via hazard pictograms on the machine.
The machine consists of moving parts that are not inherently safe by design due to the required processing speeds and corresponding acceleration and mass inertia forces. Therefore, the machine has a guard installed around it, with additional safety features at the required openings. 
## EC Declaration of Conformity
The machine complies with the requirements of the EU Machinery, Low Voltage and Electromagnetic Compatibility Directives, and therefore bears a CE mark (see §4.1). The content of the EC Declaration of Conformity is provided in Chapter 14. 
## Safety measures and features
### Safety features at the outfeed openings
**Reject outfeed**
This is the opening through which single pieces of reject products with limited dimensions are discharged. A roller conveyor that restricts accessibility options through this opening is fixed in position at the opening, which is located about 850 mm from moving machine parts. A pictogram is affixed at the opening (see §5.4).  
**Finished product outfeed**
This is the opening through which stacks of finished product (pails) are discharged. Because of the dimensions required for the stack of pails, there is a (negligible) risk that this opening will be used as an access point to the machine from the conveyor side. However, the adjacent door serves as the access point.
Additional safety features (e.g. gate, light curtain) were considered but deemed impracticable and unlikely to deliver any significant increase in safety. A roller conveyor that restricts accessibility options through this opening is fixed in position at the opening, A side guard is also installed to restrict accessibility to the moving parts from floor level. Moving machine parts are located at about 800mm from the guard. Pictograms are provided at the outfeed opening and on the outfeed conveyor (see §5.4).
 
### Access control system
The access doors are monitored by a safety contact that is connected to a safety module. The doors open when a request for access is initiated by pressing the "Open door" button. The button is fitted with a LED that flashes when the request is made, prompting the controller to put the machine in safe mode. When the machine is in safe mode, the LED will remain lit and the door may be opened. The safe mode is automatically terminated when the door is closed and the push button is pressed. If the door is opened without clearance from the access control system, an emergency stop occurs.

### Topside protection
The topside of the machine is protected by polycarbonate panels. Openings conforming to EN ISO 13857 are located near the label grippers

### Control box protection
The control box can only be opened when the main switch is set to "0". The door can be unlocked with a special key. Boxes with control current can be opened with the special key.

### Disconnecting the power sources 
To disconnect all power sources:
* Turn off the compressed air supply by closing the main valve
* Set the main switch of the control box to 0

## Pictograms
The following pictograms are provided on the machine:
* **Indicates**: risk of entanglement in moving parts, generally in the casing at infeed and outfeed openings. Enter the machine through the access doors; do not approach the machine from the outside.  
  **Location**: on polycarbonate at roller conveyor and stacker guard
* **Indicates**: risk of exposure to radiation from the laser sensors in the machine. The sensors are category # sensors and cannot damage the eyes; however, avoid eye contact as much as possible.  
  **Location**: on the access doors
* **Indicates**: risk of electrical voltage; contact with live electrical parts may be fatal. Only qualified personnel may work on the electrical equipment.  
  **Location**: on the control box
* **Indicates**: entry prohibition, in this case in the infeed and outfeed conveyors for good and rejected products. Entry may present falling hazards as well as access to/reaching into openings in the casing. Use the steps to walk past the finished product outfeed conveyor  
  **Location**: on the outfeed conveyor(s)
* **Indicates**: risk of rotating parts, in this case the infeed and outfeed conveyors. Entrapment hazard, do not remove the protective cover  
  **Location**: on the outfeed conveyor(s)
* **Indicates**: risk of high temperatures, in this case the servo motors.  
  **Location**: on the servo motor(s)
* **Indicates**: forbidden entrance  
  **Location**: rearside en reject position bad pails
* **Indicates**: Prohibited for people with pacemakers  
  **Location**: at Charge generator, above Label magazine

## Safeguarding
To ensure that maintenance can be carried out safely, the machine must be safeguarded. This involves: 
1. disconnecting the power sources (5.3.5); stopping the machine with the start/stop button.
2. discharging the energy present; disconnecting the air supply via the main valve. 
3. safeguarding against unauthorised activation: set the main switch to 0.
 
## Residual risk
One of the design objectives has been to design a machine that is safe to operate. However, there is one location in the machine where we were not able to eliminate the risk completely: The reject position. This position is marked with pictograms.
Residual risk at Outfeed:
     
## Emergency stop system
The emergency stop system is designed to avert acute hazardous situations, and is a requirement under safety legislation. The emergency stop system can also be used if there is an imminent risk of machine damage. 
The emergency stop circuits of the labelling machine and the injection moulding machine are interconnected, thus when either emergency stop button is pressed both machines are immediately switched off and the pneumatic and hydraulic circuits depressurised.  
The emergency stop buttons are located as shown in the figure below. 
  
 

## OSH tips for preventing accidents
- Keep the machine and the working environment clean and tidy.
- Provide good lighting at the workplace
- Use appropriate tools for repair and maintenance.
- Always keep safety features turned on.
- Do not remove fixed guards (panels and panes).
- Replace defective parts or safety features right away.
- Periodically check proper use of safety features.
- Do not touch live parts with a defective guard. Replace immediately. NEN 3140 or European version
- Avoid liquids or metals in the vicinity of live parts.
- Check that live cables are not damaged as a result of pulling, bending, friction caused by movement or placing (heavy) objects on the cables.
- Maintenance is by definition a high-risk activity. Always safeguard the machine and work according to the instructions in this manual. 
- Do not remove hazard pictograms; replace if damaged or removed. 
- If in doubt, do not take any risks, but consult the manufacturer.

Settings barcode reader
The machine is equipped with one barcode readers. Teaching/tuning of the readers needs to be done with a separate laptop and the software from Keyence. 
The code reader has a button labelled “Teach”, but this button only enables two laser LEDs to facilitate the alignment of the readers. (This button on the reader has the same function as “laser-aim” in the software.
With the settings screen it is possible to enter the current and the upcoming barcode. When the code reader recognises a new label, it is the signal to the conveyor and stacker to finish the current stack and start a new one. NB, this procedure is only possible when the code has been teached to the readers with the Keyence software.
 
Pressing the I/O button, gives the following screen: 
 
This screen gives the user the option to teach and tune the barcode readers from the machine environment without the dedicated PC/software present. However, without the image software or a screen to see what is happening, there is a real risk that images taken are not optimal.

# Maintenance
## General maintenance points
### Safe maintenance
Only a machine that is properly maintained can continue to work safely and accurately. It is also important to clean the machine regularly. 
Carry out maintenance according to the instructions provided below, see also the maintenance schedule in §9.4.
  Maintenance may only be performed by technically trained personnel familiar with the operation and risks of the machine. This applies to all maintenance and repair work.

  Always switch off the machine before maintenance. Insert a padlock (ø4-8) in the main switch, keep the key with you and place a warning sign: “Switched off for maintenance", including the name, start and (expected) end date.
 Assure the machines safety as described in §5.

 Never disable safety devices
 Do not remove fixed guards (panels and windows).

### General considerations
- Clean the machine regularly, remove dirt and debris. Keep the surrounding area clean as well.
- Periodically check for damage, loosened fixings or other visual and auditory abnormalities. 
- Periodically check the air cylinders and hoses for leaks.
- Keep vacuum ducts and hoses clean. 
 
## Lubrication
### Linear Systems
Proper lubrication is essential to the efficient performance of the linear system. Improper lubrication will result not only in increased risk of wear, but also in significant shortening of the service life.
Lubrication:
- Reduces wear and friction resistance, such as internal erosion of the moving parts.
- Creates an even coating of grease on the conveyor belts, reducing the load pressure and extending the service life.
- Protects metal surfaces against corrosion.
To avoid compromising the linear system's performance and maintaining the lubrication over a prolonged period of time, the lubricant used must be compatible with the ambient conditions and meet all specific requirements.
In general, a lubrication interval of 5000 km operating capacity or a minimum of once per # months must be observed. This capacity may be lower under special ambient conditions. Relevant factors may include:
▪ Extreme operating temperatures;
▪ Influence of condensation and splash water;
▪ High vibration load;
▪ Deposit from certain substances (acids, hydrocarbons);
▪ High dynamic use;
▪ Permanently small stroke movements.
The lubrication of the linear system is done using the grease nipple on the linear carriage and a suitable grease gun. Make sure to use a grease gun with a known discharge rate (such as THK MG70) and the appropriate type of grease. Please be aware that excessive grease can lead to excessive pressure in the bearing block, which can cause premature failure. Refer to the relubrication table for the recommended amount and consult the maintenance schedule for the appropriate intervals.
  Grease Type: Lithium based EP2 grease (for example THK AFB-LF Grease)
 Too much grease can cause premature failure
 
Relubrication table
Bearing block size Relubrication quantity (cm3)
15 0.6
20 1.2
25 2.0
30 3.0
35 (length ca. 122 mm) 3.4
35L (length ca. 152 mm) 5.2

Lubrication of reduction gearboxes
The reduction gearboxes are provided with synthetic oil. The oil in the reduction gearbox must be changed after 10,000-12,000 operating hours or at a minimum after # years. Note that PG 220 synthetic oil is also used. 0.2L of oil must be provided for a Zae worm gearbox.
The following oil types are recommended:
Aral  Degol GS 220
BP  BP Energol SG-XP220
Esso Umlaufol S220
Mobil Mobil Glygoyl 30
Shell Tivela Oil WB
Tribol Tribol 800/220
### Lubrication of drum motors (if present)
The drum motors are provided with oil. The first oil replenishment/change is recommended after 200-300 operating hours, each further change after 10,000 operating hours. The oil specification is 100cST/40ºC or 8ngler/50ºC. The oil is suitable for ambient temperatures from -20ºC to +50ºC. If another type of oil is used, make sure that it does not contain any additives that may damage the motor insulation. In no event may oils with graphite, molybdenum sulphite or another electrically conductive additive, be used as these will damage the drum motor.
The following oil types are recommended:
Fina Giran N100
Gastrol Alpha ZN 100

To change the oil, remove the filling bolt on the flange on the connection side of the drum motor. When installing the drum motor, always make sure that the filling bolt or red dot is located on top, otherwise cooling cannot be guaranteed. ## litres of oil is required for a 110 type, 300mm long drum motor, a 350mm long motor provides ## litres of oil and 400mm one provides ## litres. Make sure that the oil is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner.
Timing belts (if applicable)
  The machine is equipped with timing belts for performing a variety of movements. The timing belt drives must be regularly inspected. 

### Checklist for maintenance of timing belts
- Switch off the drive.
- Place all machine parts in a safe (neutral) position
- Check the belt for wear or damage. Replace if necessary. See Installation of timing belts.
- Check the disks and gears and replace if worn or damaged.
- Also check other drive components such as bearings, shafts, mounting points, etc.
- Check belt tension and adjust if necessary.
- Recheck alignment of disks.
- Connect the machine and let the drive run. Look and listen for abnormalities.
### Installation of timing belts
1. After switching off the machine and locking the main switch, disconnect the attachment points in the motor or the tensioner. Remove the belt without bending or twisting it. Do not twist a belt off the disk!
2. Remove and inspect the old belts. Abnormal or excessive wear may indicate improper maintenance.
3. Choose the proper replacement belt. (Refer to the mechanical parts list).
4. Clean the disks and tensioners with a cloth that is slightly moistened with a mild, non-volatile solvent. Do not use a sharp object to remove grease or dirt from the belt. Belts must be fitted dry onto the drive.
5. Check the gears for extraordinary or excessive wear. Also check the alignment. Correct alignment is particularly critical in synchronous belts.
6. Check the other drive components. Are bearings and shafts properly aligned, well lubricated? Are they worn out?
7. Install the new belt on the gears. Do not twist or use force to mount it.
8. Adjust the belt until the tension gauge shows the correct tension. Turn the drives a few revolutions by hand and check the tension again.
9. Properly tighten the bolts of the mounting points in the motor or the tensioner. All drive components must be firmly secured in place because any change to the centre distance compromises the drive's performance.
10. Although the belts do not require re-tensioning, we recommend that you let the drive run and observe it carefully. Look and listen for unusual noises and vibrations. Switch off the machine and check the bearings and motor. If they feel hot to the touch, the belt may be too tight, or the bearings may be misaligned or improperly lubricated.
Tension of the timing belts
The tension of the timing belts should be checked according to maintenance schedule see §9.3. Use a sonic tension meter to determine the belt tension.
The distance between centreline of the pulley and the start of the belt clamps is called span. Use a paperclip on the belt in order to measure the frequency. Glass fibre is used instead of steel wires. See the user manual of the sonic tension meter for operating instructions
